### 1. Obstructive sleep apnea and risk of age-related macular degeneration: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
- Authors: Luke Yaldo et al. | Date: 2026-Feb-13 | PMID: 41692178 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41692178/) | DOI: 10.1016/j.ajo.2026.02.016

**Abstract (EN)**

We evaluated whether obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with an increased risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The population included adults with and without OSA. Outcomes included overall AMD risk and AMD stage-specific outcomes, including neovascular AMD (nAMD), non-neovascular AMD, late AMD with geographic atrophy (GA), and anti-VEGF therapy requirement.
AMD is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss worldwide. OSA, characterized by intermittent hypoxia, oxidative stress, and vascular dysregulation, shares key pathogenic mechanisms with AMD. Understanding whether OSA increases AMD risk could help identify high-risk populations for earlier detection, monitoring, and intervention.
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched to June 27, 2025, supplemented by Google Scholar and citation tracking. Eligible studies reported AMD outcomes in both OSA and non-OSA groups. Methodological quality was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool. Random-effects models were used to pool odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs). Certainty of evidence was evaluated with the GRADE framework. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251119881).
Eight studies (3,536,314 participants; 207,130 with OSA) were analyzed. In crude analyses, OSA was associated with higher odds of AMD (OR=1.45; 95%CI: 1.13-1.84; low certainty) with similar increases for nAMD (OR=1.76; 95%CI: 1.06-2.93; low certainty) and non-neovascular AMD (OR=1.95; 95%CI: 1.04-3.66; low certainty). No significant associations were observed in subgroups without confounder adjustment (low certainty) or with regression adjustment (low certainty), whereas propensity-score matched studies indicated higher odds (OR=1.92; 95%CI: 1.05-3.52; low certainty). Adjusted analyses confirmed the association (aOR=1.44; 95%CI: 1.11-1.77; moderate certainty) with no heterogeneity. Time-to-event analyses showed an increased hazard of AMD (aHR=1.66; 95%CI: 1.13-2.19; low certainty), though stage-specific analyses for neovascular and non-neovascular AMD were not significant (very low certainty).
OSA may be associated with an increased risk of AMD, though the certainty of evidence ranges from moderate to very low. Variability in diagnostic criteria for OSA and AMD, high heterogeneity in several analyses, and reliance on observational data limit the strength of inference.

### 2. The Association Between Diabetic Retinopathy Severity and Dementia Risk: A TriNetX Longitudinal Cohort Study.
- Authors: Millen S Khangura et al. | Date: 2026-Feb-13 | PMID: 41692179 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41692179/) | DOI: 10.1016/j.ajo.2026.02.014

**Abstract (EN)**

Diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) have been associated with higher incidence of dementia and may serve as clinical indicators for underlying cognitive disease. This study investigated whether severity of DR is linked to increased risk of dementia.
Retrospective cohort study.
Participants were categorized into four groups: proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), nonproliferative DR (NPDR), type 2 DM (DM2) without DR, and no DM. Individuals under age 65 and those with macular edema were excluded.
Groups were propensity score matched 1:1 for demographic and clinical covariates. Outcomes included incidence of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD), assessed using Cox proportional hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Kaplan-Meier analysis evaluated time to dementia onset.
Incidence and hazard ratios of all-cause dementia, AD, and VD.
The TriNetX database identified 14,034 individuals with PDR, 29,188 individuals with NPDR, 208,640 with DM2 without DR, and 447,054 without DM. Compared to non-diabetics, all three diabetic groups (PDR, NPDR, and DM2 without DR) had a higher risk of all-cause dementia (HR 1.583, p<0.0001 PDR; 1.405, p<0.0001 NPDR; 1.262, p<0.0001 DM2 without DR), AD (HR 1.175, p=0.0419 PDR; 1.233, p<0.0001 NPDR; 1.117, p<0.0001 DM2 without DR), and VD (HR 2.077, p<0.0001 PDR; 1.917, p<0.0001 NPDR; 1.384, p<0.0001 DM2 without DR). Compared to participants with DM2 without DR, those with PDR and NPDR had higher risk for all-cause dementia (HR 1.202, p<0.0001 PDR; 1.113, p<0.0001 NPDR) and VD (HR 1.504, p<0.0001 PDR; 1.322, p<0.0001 NPDR), but not AD. When stratified by DR severity, PDR was associated with a higher risk of all-cause dementia (HR 1.121, p=0.0003 PDR) and VD (HR 1.177, p=0.0126 PDR), but not AD, compared to NPDR.
Greater severity of DR is associated with an increased risk of all-cause dementia and VD in individuals with DM2 without DR, whereas AD risk appears elevated only when compared to nondiabetic participants. These findings suggest that progressive DR reflect systemic microvascular injury that parallels cerebral small vessel disease. Routine ophthalmologic screening in patients with DM may provide an opportunity for early identification of individuals at higher risk of cognitive decline.

### 1. Long Term Outcomes After Implantation of Sutureless Intrascleral Fixation Lenses Following Complicated Cataract Surgery - A Single Center Retrospective Study.
- Authors: Viren Govindaraju et al. | Date: 2026-Feb-13 | PMID: 41707119 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41707119/) | DOI: 10.1097/IAE.0000000000004816

**Abstract (EN)**

We report our long term outcomes and potential complications after using the SIS technique to repair patients following complicated cataract surgery.
This is a retrospective cohort study of patients that had SIS surgery due to retained lens fragments from January 2015 to January 2025 at Associated Retinal Consultants. Charts were manually reviewed to ensure consistent SIS technique was used in all participants, were followed for at least 6 months, and to analyze main outcome measures.
149 patients met inclusion criteria with an average follow up time of 918 days. Most patients had the MA60AC lens (96 patients) or ZA9003 lens (32 patients) placed. 3 patients and 4 patients had the AR40 and CT Lucia IOL respectively. Endophthalmitis rate was 2.0%, all cases in the MA60AC group, with an average time of 1469 days, 11% had IOL dislocations at an average of 442 days, 5% had vitreous hemorrhage at an average of 441 days, and 4% had a retinal detachment at an average of 707 days. No difference among IOL types was found between the anatomic outcomes analyzed.
Following successful SIS IOL implantation, we can see patients develop endophthalmitis, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and IOL dislocation.

### 1. Biomarker changes of choroidal architecture preceding myopia onset in Chinese school children: a 3-year prospective cohort study.
- Authors: Hao Wu et al. | Date: 2026-Feb-13 | PMID: 41690696 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41690696/) | DOI: 10.1136/bjo-2025-328308

**Abstract (EN)**

To characterise the temporal dynamics of choroidal changes relative to myopia onset and determine their associations with myopia onset in school children.
The 3-year prospective cohort study consisted of 180 emmetropic school-children. Cycloplegic auto-refractions were performed annually. Choroidal images acquired via swept-source optical coherence tomography until myopia onset were analysed. Choroidal architecture was characterised based on submacular choroidal thickness (ChT), choroidal vascularity index (CVI), luminal area (LA), stromal area (SA) and total choroidal area (TCA) measurements. Time to myopia onset was defined as the first annual follow-up visit with spherical equivalent ≤-0.50 dioptres.
A total of 165 participants (330 eyes, 91.7%) who completed at least one annual follow-up were included. During 36 months, 168 eyes of 100 participants developed myopia. Refractive shift and axial elongation showed significant non-linear trends in which they accelerated dramatically approximately 2 years prior to myopia onset. Notably, ChT, as well as CVI, LA, SA and TCA, exhibited significant linear declines throughout the 3 years when these eyes progressed to myopia, whereas they remained unchanged in persistent non-myopic eyes. Multivariable accelerated failure time models showed that a greater decline rate of these choroidal parameters (per SD) shortened the time to myopia onset, with time ratios ranging from 1.26 to 1.76. The area under receiver-operating characteristic curves for annual choroidal changes effectively distinguished incident myopia (0.83-0.89).
Alterations in choroidal architecture are an early indicator for the disruption of normal emmetropisation and the onset of myopia.

### 2. The Manchester buckle study: 15-year outcomes and predictive factors for success in scleral buckling for primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.
- Authors: Myrta Lippera et al. | Date: 2026-Feb-17 | PMID: 41702685 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41702685/) | DOI: 10.1136/bjo-2025-328525

**Abstract (EN)**

To assess the long-term anatomical and visual outcomes of primary scleral buckle (SB) surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) and identify predictors of surgical and functional success.
All primary SB procedures performed at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital between January 2008 and December 2023 were reviewed retrospectively. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data were extracted from electronic records. Primary end-points were single-surgery anatomical success (SSAS) and final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA); univariate and multivariate regression analyses examined predictive variables and complications.
608 eyes were included. SSAS was achieved in 515 eyes (85%) and final anatomical success in 602 eyes (99%). Mean BCVA improved from 0.62±0.85 to 0.32±0.49 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) (p<0.01). On multivariate analysis, age >40 years (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.83; p=0.004), macula-off status (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97; p=0.034) and ocular trauma (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.82; p=0.012) independently reduced SSAS. For visual outcomes, macula-off detachment (β=+0.36; p<0.001) and ocular trauma (β=+0.42; p<0.001) were independent predictors of worse postoperative BCVA. The most common complications were subretinal haemorrhage (4.6%), inadvertent deep sutures (3.9%) and postoperative ocular hypertension (7.4%).
Primary SB provided high anatomical success, significant visual improvement and a favourable safety profile in this large single-centre study. Age above 40 years, macula-off status and ocular trauma predicted poorer SSAS; trauma and macula-off status were also associated with worse postoperative BCVA on multivariate logistic regression.
